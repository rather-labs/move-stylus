# Account

An account is a way to identify a user. An account is generated from a private key, and is identified by an address. An account can own objects (*within* the contract, [more on that later](../object_model)), and can send transactions.

Every transaction has a sender and a signer, and the sender is identified by an address. The sender is the address that initiates the transaction and acts as its origin on the blockchain, while the signer is the authority that provides the cryptographic signature to authorize the action.
