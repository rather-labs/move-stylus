# Introduction

Welcome to Move. Move is a programming language designed by Meta (formerly Facebook) for building secure and reliable smart contracts and digital assets. It is the language behind the Diem blockchain. It was later adopted by Aptos and Sui blockchains.

Move is designed with a focus on safety and flexibility. It introduces several novel concepts that make it well-suited for blockchain applications, including resource types, strong static typing, and a modular architecture. Move takes its cue from Rust by using resource types with move (hence the name) semantics as an explicit representation of digital assets.

Move for Stylus makes possible to compile and run Move programs in the Arbitrum blockchain by translating it to WebAssembly and integrating it with [Stylus VM](https://docs.arbitrum.io/stylus/gentle-introduction).

This book aims to provide a comprehensive introduction to the Move programming language. It covers the fundamental concepts of Move, including its syntax, semantics, and key features.
