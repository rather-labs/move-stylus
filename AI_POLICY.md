# AI Usage Policy

Moving Stylus enforces strict rules for AI use:

- **All AI use must be disclosed.** State the tool used (e.g., Claude Code, Cursor, Copilot) and how much of the work was AI-assisted.

- **AI-assisted pull requests must be tied to accepted issues.** Drive-by PRs that do not reference an accepted issue will be closed. If AI use is suspected but not disclosed, the PR will be closed. If you want to share code for a non-accepted issue, open a discussion or attach it to an existing discussion.

- **AI-generated PRs must be fully verified by a human.** Do not submit hypothetically correct code that hasn’t been tested. You must not use AI to write code for platforms or environments you cannot manually test.

- **Issues and discussions may use AI only with a human in the loop.** Any AI-generated content must be reviewed and edited by a human before submission. AI often adds noise and verbosity; humans must research and trim to the point.

These rules apply to external contributors only. Maintainers are exempt and may use AI at their discretion.

## There Are Humans Here

Please remember that Moving Stylus is maintained by people.

Every issue, discussion, and pull request is read and reviewed by humans (and sometimes machines, too). This boundary is where people interact with each other and the work. Low-effort or unqualified submissions are disrespectful because they shift the burden of validation onto maintainers.

In an ideal world, AI would always produce accurate work. Today, the quality depends on the person using the tool. Until people get better, AI gets better, or both, these rules are necessary to protect maintainers.

## AI Is Welcome Here

Moving Stylus itself is built with AI assistance, and maintainers actively use AI tools. As a project, we welcome AI as a tool.

**The strict AI policy is not anti-AI.** It exists because too many unqualified contributors misuse AI. The problem is the people, not the tools.

This section is included to be transparent about the project’s AI usage and to address the misconception that this policy is anti-AI in nature.
